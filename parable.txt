A successful pop-up Halloween store owner and mother to two and a half, Karen's life is turned upside down when she discovers her workers are underpaid, undermotivated, and tired of dressing up like clowns. Karen soon finds herself backed against a wall - losing money fast, with her children getting into alternative disco and a bomb rigged in her chest set to explode, Karen has no idea what to do and only two months to turn things around. But one day, she has a chance encounter with a wily plastic surgeon who imparts some unexpected advice. Through the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Surgeons, Karen may have a chance to save her failing pop-up Halloween store. Can Karen master her mentor's advice and turn her business around, or will it be Bye Bye Beauty Pie?

BUSINESS PARABLE GENERATOR
This is a full stack web application that generates pithy summaries of business parables. I'm struck by how all business parables sound exactly the same so I figure it'll be simple to make something that creates one on the fly.

Will probably need:
-Node (to work with MongoDB)
-MongoDB (I want to use this to practice full stack databases)
-React (want to get sharper with this skill)
-Express (to manage Node)

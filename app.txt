BUSINESS PARABLE GENERATOR
This is a full stack web application that generates pithy summaries of business parables. I'm struck by how all business parables sound exactly the same so I figure it'll be simple to make something that creates one on the fly.

Will probably need:
-Node (to work with MongoDB)
-MongoDB (I want to use this to practice full stack databases)
-React (want to get sharper with this skill)
-Express (to manage Node)
-Mocha (would really like to practice formal testing, and Jest was a little too tricky for me to understand; we'll try Mocha)
-TypeScript (want to train further in this)
-Bootstrap (CSS styling)

POSSIBLE STRUCTURE:
-app.js (run code, basic '/' route, render pages)
-index.jsx (runs the react code - but might probably have to connect to a Node backend: however, React could be dropped in as a <script>?)
-components folder (button, main app component, generated parable text)
-routes folder? 
-The React app (hosted on Heroku) would have to connect with a MongoDB database (also hosted on Heroku, maybe, or MongoDB Atlas for cloud)
--React is just for the render client side; still would be within the app itself committed to Heroku

/controller
../functions
/model
../database
/view
../components

STEPS:
-set up hello world app using React and Node backend connected; we'll probably establish the NodeJS backend first, then create a seperate React app as a client that points to it
-attach bare MongoDB to hello world app to ensure connectivity; would probably be best served doing MongoDB Atlas and connecting that way
-set up component design and functionality to generate one of two results, touching the entire stack
-add further options for parable generation in DB
-optimize app with better front end design


## LOG
5/25
-planned out structure of app

5/26
-set up Express hello world
-installed express/mongoose/dotenv/mocha/chai/typescript/cors/body-parser/axios packages
-further planning of step by step app build approach
NEXT: use Axios to set up router with new create-react-app and understand WHY that works

5/27
-install axios
-create react app: client; tested to make sure it runs
-added and exported custom component to test
-began developing React component state designed to use axios to pull from backend; need to test
MORE STUDY NEEDED: HTTP requests, React fundamentals review

5/28
-set up full frontend/backend connection (watch for typos)
-signed up for MongoDB Atlas (cloud DB) and configured for new project and data cluster.
-installed mongodb package
-started configure: Node connection to Atlas via Mongoose to load up sample DB

5/29
-got Mongoose setup and connected to MongoDB Atlas
-tested connection
-setting up Schema and model to work with test collection
-able to connect to test collection in DB

5/30
tested MongoDB with own schema/model and adding data
-planned how to get data from Atlas to Node backend to React frontend
-able to successfully get Node to pull up MongoDB data object
NEXT: need to test React's ability to pull and initially render data

5/31
-had a lot of trouble working with React's async state and updating it with data; will try using button to grab it since the parable gen will have a button
-got state to do better BUT to make sure it doesn't reset, you want to pass the state into the parent component and then pass it down via props

6/1
-pushed state to App component and props down into child component: still same problem, wonder if the component mount is resetting it
-had to revamp connection to backend and frontend
-used e.preventDefault to prevent state reversion on click event
NEXT: work on successfully passing backend data to frontend for use: use .fetch through axios

NEXT STEPS:
-plot out data model for app (read how to do this in NoSQL)
-create own Atlas collection
-define Schema/model for it
-test insert, delete, and read data
-set up procedure to read data, pass to app, and render to React (grab json/pass json/map json to render for each entry in component)
-create better outline for app structure: views, DB connection, DB functions, etc.
